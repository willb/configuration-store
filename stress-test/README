Basic setup; WALLABYREPO is a shorthand for the directory of your
wallaby repo checkout.

1.  Make sure that you have capricious installed, either via RubyGems
(gem install capricious), from source (github.com/willb/capricious/),
or by ensuring that the git submodule for capricious is checked out.

2.  Run your wallaby agent as usual.  (If you're running under the
profiler, you will be dramatically limited in the sorts of scale
testing that you can comfortably do.)

3.  Ensure that ${WALLABYREPO}/lib and ${WALLABYREPO}/stress-test/lib are
in your ruby path:

export WALLABY_ST_PATH=${WALLABYREPO}/lib:${WALLABYREPO}/stress-test/lib

4.  Run the stress test fixture script (stress-test/bin/wallaby-st-fixture).
It is mostly self-documenting (note that you'll need "-rrubygems" if
you're using the gem version of capricious):

ruby -I$WALLABY_ST_PATH -rrubygems ./stress-test/bin/wallaby-st-fixture -h

You can specify the size of your store (and, indirectly, roughly how
many objects to create) by specifying the parameters of the
probability distributions from which the numbers of nodes, params,
features, groups, and subsystems are drawn (as well as the
"connectedness" of the object graph, viz., the mean number of how many
groups each node is in, etc.).  I don't claim that the default values
model anything useful or realistic (just medium-size and reasonably
complex) and welcome suggestions for improvements.

5.  If you used the -a option to wallaby-st-fixture, the config will
be validated and activated (which may be expensive but should not time
out).  Now you can use the standard wallaby tools (wallaby-inventory,
wallaby-dump, wallaby-restore) to exercise the agent (and QMF).
